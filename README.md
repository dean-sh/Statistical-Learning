# Statistical Machine Learning Algorithms, implemented in R

**In this repo I present Various Statistical and Machine Learning Algorithms, mainly from the ISLR book and datasets**

**Topics: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Trees & Random Forest, KNN, SVM etc.**
In addition to important Machine Learning methods such as **Cross-Validation, Model & Feature Selection, Regularization**. 

All the models are initially implemented from scratch, and later using the prebuilt libraries.
